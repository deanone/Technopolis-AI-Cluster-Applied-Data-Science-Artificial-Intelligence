This repository contains the original content I created for the purposes of the "Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence" course, organized by the Technopolis AI Cluster (https://www.ai-cluster.gr/), in which I participated as a tutor.

The repository contains material, in the form of Jupyter notebooks along with the corresponding datasets, regarding the following lectures:

1. Lecture 4 - Data engineering with Python
	1. Anaconda
	2. NumPy
	3. SciPy
	4. pandas
	5. scikit-learn
	6. matplotlib
	7. Jupyer Notebooks
	8. Spyder
2. Lecture 24 - Convolutional Neural Networks (III):
	1. Class Activation Map (CAM)
	2. Global Average Pooling (GAP)
	3. Grad-CAM
	4. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
	5. Node classification
	6. Masked arrays
	7. Custom Keras layers via Keras subclassing
3. Lecture 26 - Sequence Models (I):
	1. Sequence data
	2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
	3. Revisiting backpropagation
	4. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
	5. Vanishing gradient problem
	6. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
	7. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
	8. Bidirectional RNNs
	9. 1D convolution for sequences
	10. Keras layers
